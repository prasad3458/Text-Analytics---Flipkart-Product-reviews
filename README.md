# Text-Analytics-reviews

# The project aims to analyze customer reviews and ratings from Flipkart, a prominent e-commerce platform in India, to uncover insights into consumer behavior. Through text and sentiment analysis, the study seeks to predict customer repurchase intentions and assess overall sentiment towards products. The objectives include determining if reviews and ratings can predict repurchasing, gauging customer sentiment, and informing business strategies for Flipkart. The dataset, sourced from Kaggle, consists of product reviews with associated metrics like ratings and sentiment labels. The proposed plan includes data cleaning, exploratory analysis, sentiment classification, and building a prediction model for repurchase intentions. Additionally, the project offers opportunities for trend analysis, association rule mining, and customer segmentation, ultimately contributing to a deeper understanding of e-commerce consumer behavior and informing strategic decisions for business growth.
# We uses SAS Enterprise Miner for this Entire Project
